Benefits of Resource-Based Authorization:
Fine-Grained Access Control: By associating permissions with individual resources (such as endpoints or data objects), resource-based authorization allows for granular control over who can access what.

Least Privilege Principle: Implementing resource-based authorization enables adhering to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that clients only have access to the resources they are eligible for, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.
