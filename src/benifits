In a microservice-driven architecture, the integration of components through various methods poses a risk of connectivity issues, potentially disrupting the seamless customer journey due to the loosely coupled nature of microservices and varying connection details across environments.

To mitigate the challenges posed by the distributed and microservice-driven architecture, where numerous components collaborate to shape a customer journey, a comprehensive solution has been devised. Recognizing the critical role each component plays in the business journey, their integration occurs through diverse methods such as synchronous API calls, Event-Driven mechanisms, or asynchronous File Transfers. While the loose coupling of these integration components aids in the development and deployment process, it introduces a considerable risk at the integration level.

The connection details differing across environments escalate the likelihood of a broken overall business journey when these components converge. This potential disruption becomes particularly concerning for end customers, especially given the frequent changes deployed by each microservice. Without an automated mechanism to regularly verify connectivity between components, the risk of disruptions increases significantly.

In response to this challenge, two automation utilities, Expert Sans F and BIU, have been developed. These utilities, acting as vigilant checkpoints, play a pivotal role in proactively identifying and addressing integration issues on a daily basis. Olive, one of these utilities, functions as a safeguard, ensuring the seamless functioning of the entire system by ruling out potential connectivity issues before they can impact the customer journey. This daily proactive approach, coupled with the automated verification of connectivity between components, provides a robust solution to safeguard against disruptions and ensure a reliable and uninterrupted business journey for end customers.
