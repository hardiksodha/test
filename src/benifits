Proven Benefits to Date:

✓ Facilitates a flexible connection between infrastructure and code. This flexibility allows various components to deploy their code on their timelines, with infrastructure set up on day one to alleviate downstream/upstream release planning constraints.

✓ Resolves integration issues proactively, including tasks such as whitelisting IPs, ensuring the correct certificates, validating TIAA users, managing roles/permissions, confirming API endpoints, handling event serialization/deserialization, validating event schemas, and ensuring the correctness of event sources and destinations well in advance of actual live traffic arrival.

✓ Streamlines and expedites the development of applications, enabling integrated testing throughout the process.

✓ Minimizes reliance on live proofs or actual customer data for validating integrations between components.
