Criteria | Single Topic | Multiple Topics
Message Format / Schema | All producers must follow a common schema | Different producers can have custom schemas
Event Volume | Easier if event volume is manageable | Scales better under high throughput
Consumer Logic | Consumer must route based on sender or eventType | Each topic can have dedicated consumers
Isolation & Fault Tolerance | Issues in one sender’s message format may affect others | Problems are isolated to a single topic
Operational Complexity | Fewer topics to manage | More topics, more ACLs/configs to manage
Monitoring & Alerting | Harder to isolate sender-specific issues | Easier to track sender-specific metrics
Retention & Cleanup Policy | One policy for all messages | Fine-grained control per topic


Use Single Topic If:
All producers follow the same schema (or versioned schemas).

Volume is moderate and consumer logic is simple.

You want simpler operations (fewer topics).

You're using schema registry and can evolve schemas safely.

Example:
Topic: all-app-events

Message: includes sender_id, event_type, payload

✅ Use Multiple Topics If:
Producers have different payload structures.

You want clear separation of concerns.

Your app needs fine-grained access control (e.g. only App A can write to app-a-events).

You need to scale or troubleshoot per app easily.

Example:
Topics: app-a-events, app-b-events, app-c-events

Each has its own retention/processing pipeline
